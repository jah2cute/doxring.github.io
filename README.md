# Doxbin
This is a copy of the popular site [doxbin.org](https://doxbin.org) meant for releasing doxxes.

# Stack
It's written in what I call the old-school MEVN stack (MySQL, Express.js, Vue.js, Node.js).


# Deployment
Everything has already been dockerized so it's just starting up the containers.
Note: You do have to change API endpoint in frontend.
